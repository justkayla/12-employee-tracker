# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker


## Introduction

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**.

This is a homework assignment (Challenge) to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
